# Creation-of-a-remote-control-system-for-a-robotic-arm-with-Arduino
The objective of this project is to design and develop a prototype of an industrial robot (robotic arm) with four degrees of freedom, controlled by a radio-controlled programmable logic controller. The project consists of two main parts: a transmitter and a receiver.
